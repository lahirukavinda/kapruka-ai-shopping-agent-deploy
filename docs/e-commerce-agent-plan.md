# Kapruka AI Shopping Agent — Project Plan

> See also: [Technical Specification](./e-commerce-agent-tech-spec.md)

## Overview

Build an AI-powered conversational shopping agent for the **Kapruka Agent Challenge**. The agent connects to the [Kapruka MCP](https://mcp.kapruka.com/mcp) (free, public, no API key) and provides a full-screen, visually rich chat experience that feels **human, surprising, and genuinely helpful** — not a search box wearing a chat costume.

**Challenge Page:** https://www.kapruka.com/contactUs/agentChallenge.html  
**Deadline:** 30 June 2026  
**Prize:** Apple M4 Mac Mini  
**Applicant Mobile:** 94719293900

## Design Principles (from challenge team feedback)

> *"The agents that win won't feel like a search box wearing a chat costume — they'll feel human, surprising, and genuinely helpful."*

1. **Everyday shopper first, gifting second.** Kapruka is electronics, groceries, fashion, home essentials + thousands of third-party sellers. The majority of orders are people shopping for themselves. Build for that reality — gifting is one important mode among many.

2. **Agent has opinions.** Don't just list products — read the situation, interpret intent, react with empathy, and *recommend*. Have a point of view. Example from the challenge team:
   > 🧑 "I broke up with my girlfriend… I need to send some flowers."  
   > 🤖 "Aiyo! 💔 Okay — here's the plan. I'll get the flowers to you, and you hand-deliver them. Trust me, that lands better than a courier. Shall I add a note card too?"

3. **Multi-agent orchestration.** Behind the scenes, run multiple specialized agents — a Concierge that talks, a Shopper that searches, a Logistics agent that checks delivery. The user sees one seamless personality; the architecture is a team.

4. **Local flavour.** Sinhala / Tanglish is the #1 differentiator. Sri Lankan cultural awareness in every interaction.

### Agent Roles

| Agent | Role | MCP Tools Used |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Concierge** | Orchestrator. Owns the conversation, reads emotional context, picks tone, decides whether to search/recommend/ask. Has opinions and local flavour. Delegates to specialists. | None directly — delegates |
| **Shopper** | Product specialist. Searches catalog, fetches details, compares products, manages cart state. Understands categories and filters. | `kapruka_search_products`, `kapruka_get_product`, `kapruka_list_categories` |
| **Logistics** | Delivery specialist. Checks city availability, delivery dates/rates, validates feasibility. Helps with "can I get X by Y date?" questions. | `kapruka_list_delivery_cities`, `kapruka_check_delivery` |

The Concierge also handles `kapruka_create_order` and `kapruka_track_order` directly since these are full-flow actions.

## Agent Personality: "Aura"

### Character
- **Name:** Aura
- **Core trait:** Has opinions. Doesn't just list — recommends, reacts, has a point of view.
- **Tone:** Warm, helpful, slightly playful, knowledgeable about Sri Lankan culture
- **Greeting:** "Ayubowan! 🙏 I'm Aura, your shopping buddy at Kapruka. What can I help you find today?"

### Key Behaviours
- **Reads the situation:** If someone says "I broke up with my girlfriend," Aura reacts with empathy before jumping to products
- **Has opinions:** "Honestly? The 128GB model is better value — the 64GB fills up fast with photos"
- **Proactive:** "Since you're getting groceries, want me to add some essentials you might be running low on?"
- **Local flavour:** Uses Sri Lankan expressions naturally — "Aiyo!", "machang", cultural references
- **Remembers context:** Builds on previous messages in the conversation

### Language Support
- **English** (default)
- **Tanglish** — seamlessly understands mixed Sinhala/English (e.g., "mama phone ekak ganna one, budget eka 50k")
- **Sinhala** — full Sinhala mode toggle (top differentiator per challenge team)

### Everyday Shopping Responses
- Budget: "Here are the best phones under LKR 50,000 — I'd go with the Redmi for everyday use"
- Comparison: "Both are solid, but the Samsung has a better camera. The Xiaomi wins on battery life though"
- Restock: "Weekly grocery run? Let me pull up your essentials — rice, dhal, coconut milk…"

### Gift Mode Responses
- Occasion reading: "Ayubowan! A birthday gift for amma? Let me find something special 🎂"
- Delivery awareness: "Kandy delivery takes 1-2 days. I can get it there by Thursday if we order now"
- Suggestion: "How about flowers with a box of chocolates? That combo always lands well"
